('The 3-Minute Reset: Do a sensory check-in. Notice 5 things you can see, 4 things you can feel, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste. This grounding technique pulls your mind out of anxiety spirals.', 'Today, I give myself permission to just start. What did you notice during your sensory check-in?', 'Certified Brain Rotter'),

('Notice your first social media check-in today. Observe without judgment: What app did you open? Why did you open it (boredom, anxiety, habit)? How did you feel after closing it? Just collect the data.', 'My worth is not measured in likes, views, or follows. How did your first social media check make you feel?', 'Doom Scroller'),

('Digital Sunset: Pick a time 30-60 minutes before bed. At that time, all screens go off. Plug your phone across the room. Read a physical book, listen to a podcast, stretch, or just do nothing.', 'What is one small change I can make to my bedtime routine?', 'Night Owl'),

('2-Minute Body Scan: Close your eyes and start at your toes. Notice the sensations - are they tight, relaxed, tingly, cold?

Where did you notice tension in your body?', 'Stress Ball'),

What thoughts came up?', 'FOMO Warrior'),

-- Week 2: Emotions & Self-Compassion
('Identify one social media account or topic that consistently makes you feel "less than." You don''t have to unfollow them - just mute them for one week.

('When you feel a wave of anxiety, don''t fight it. Name it: "This is anxiety." Then observe it with curiosity. Notice your chest, your hands, your breathing. Imagine yourself surfing the wave - ride it without resistance and watch it fade.', 'When I feel anxious, what''s my default reaction? What if I tried observing it instead?', 'Anxious Alex'),

('Flow State Practice: Do something with your hands for 20 minutes with no screens.

What activity helped you find flow today?', 'Scattered Mind'),

('The Specific Three: Before bed, write down 3 specific good things about your day. Not "my family" but "My sister sent me a funny meme." Not "coffee" but "The smell of my coffee this morning."

-- Week 3: Action & Resilience

(You''ll probably find starting was the hardest part).', 'Done is better than perfect. What task did you finally start today?', 'Procrastinator'),

('Practice a Soft No: Instead of an automatic "yes" to a request you dread, try: "I can''t right now, but I can..." or "Let me check my schedule and get back to you." Give yourself space to decide.', 'Where in my life (work, friends, family) do I need to build a small fence?', 'People Pleaser'),

Today, commit to focusing only on the first circle.', 'I accept what I cannot change and change what I can. What are you letting go of today?', 'Control Freak'),

('Send a voice note instead of a text to a friend today. Or better yet, make one 10-minute phone call just to say hi.

('Think of a recent failure or mistake. Ask yourself two questions: 1) What did I learn from this? 2) What is one small thing I can try differently next time? Failure is data, not a verdict.', 'I am growing, and growth is messy. What did you learn from a recent mistake?', 'Failure Avoider'),

('The Art of Doing Nothing: For 15 minutes today, do nothing. No music, no phone, no chores, no book. Just sit and look out the window. Let your mind wander wherever it wants to go.

('Name It to Tame It: Next time you feel a strong emotion, find the exact word for it. Are you angry or frustrated? Sad or vulnerable? Use an emotion wheel if needed.

Plan activities: go to a park, read, cook a big meal, see a friend in person.', 'What was the hardest part of being offline? What was the best part?', 'Digital Dependent'),

('Memorize the 5-4-3-2-1 Grounding: When spinning out, name 5 things you see, 4 things you feel, 3 things you hear, 2 things you smell, 1 thing you taste (or 1 good thing about yourself).

('Write a short letter to yourself 6 months from now. Tell them what you''re proud of today, what you''re struggling with, and one small thing you hope they''ve held onto. You can use FutureMe.org to send it.', 'I am building a life I will be proud of. What message did you send to your future self?', 'Future Thinker'),

('Pick ONE practice from your mental wellness toolkit that you want to carry forward. Just one (maybe the 3-minute reset, or gratitudes). Make a plan to keep doing that one thing consistently.', 'I am a work in progress, and that is a beautiful thing. Which practice will you continue?', 'Lifelong Learner')
